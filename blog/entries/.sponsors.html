<h1>Startup Crawl Sponsors</h1>

<p>Sponsors are super important to being able to put in the crawl.  They allow our attendees to get around the crawl in a fun and safe atomosphere.  But in sponsoring they are doing more then just providing shuttles, they are actively supporting the startups in KC and the surrounding areas.  If you are a location, startup or attendees, say thanks for supporting by using their services.</p>

        <p>Kansas City Startup Foundation
        <br />The Kansas City Startup Foundation (KCSF) unifies & champions Kansas City's entrepreneur community. Our efforts foster an entrepreneurial mindset & encourage people to engage in activities that inspire innovation.
        <br />The KCSF emerged from the multi-year, volunteer efforts of Kansas City Startup Village (KCSV), which continues to help mold & change the way people think about entrepreneurship & startup communities. The entrepreneurial mindset has shifted from a solo, isolated model to one of collaboration & mutual support. Focused on the KC entrepreneurial community, we're helping to facilitate activities & relationships that lead to a quicker ramp to commercialization & monetization for entrepreneurs and startups.
