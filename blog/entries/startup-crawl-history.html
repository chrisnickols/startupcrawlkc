<h1>Startup Crawl History</h1>

<p>The startup crawl first started in Kansas City in 2013 led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/3cocktaillunch" target="_blank">Carrie Royce</a> and backed by <a href="http://www.rednovalabs.com/" target="_blank">Red Nova</a> Labs and <a href="http://www.kcstartupvillage.org/" target="_blank">Kansas City Startup Village</a>. The goal of the event was to showcase local startups, provide interactions with entrepreneurs but more importantly create lasting connections with community members. Four shuttles ran at the first crawl to six area locations that showcased nearly fifty startups and related services. The event grew over the next three years with over 100 startups hosted at 11 venues and 800 community members crawling from one location to another. As part of 1 week KC, it become one of the amazing startup events in the metro area.</p>
<p>Several of the organizers and sponsors have moved on but realized the event should not disappear and handed over the reigns to the next team. One thing that is important to this new team is creating those same great interactions with entrepreneurs and connecting with startups.
