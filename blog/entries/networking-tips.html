<h1>Tips for great networking</h1>

<p>If you're anything like me you approach most big networking opportunities with a mix of excitement and apprehension--if you're not pre-wired for it, it can be really tough to walk into an environment full of unknowns, new people and energy where you feel like you have to be "on" the whole time. The benefit of these types of events, however, outweigh the cons in the amount of new connections, new ideas and perspectives as well as the opportunity to forge some valuable working relationships. As we get ready to ramp up our reach for the 2016 StartUpCrawl KC Event, we've compiled this list of sure-fire ways to make it an awesome experience.</p>

<p>1. Smile
<br />So this one seems like a no-brainer but it's easy to overlook in the hustle and bustle of a big event. Whether it's smiling at the bus driver as you board to check out the next location or offering a smile to someone who looks like they've had a long day, this simple gesture can go a long way towards making everyone's event more enjoyable and fun. You'll brighten everyone's day while inviting some good energy and conversation.

<p>2. Come Prepared
<br />While this looks different for each person depending on their personality and business, there are a few simple things you can do to make sure you're prepared for the big event and all the opportunities it brings. First and foremost, business cards. We'll say it again--bring business cards. Lots of business cards. Second, don't hesitate to write out a small "pitch" for your business if you find you have a hard time explaining it. It's easier than thinking something up on the fly and you'll come across as less nervous if you're prepared. Last but not least, make sure you have a pen. I know--it's so last century but being able to jot yourself a note about the really interesting person you just met is really valuable and spending too much time on your phone can be really isolating.</p>

<p>3. Make "Medium Talk"
<br />Do what? Instead of "small talk" people are now expressing their love for "medium talk". We think the name is sort of hokey too but the idea is gold: instead of letting yourself get sucked into the same ol' 'So what do you do?' routine, take the time to figure out what a more interesting twist could be. Even if you end up not making a real connection with the person you're talking to, it can't hurt to try.

<p>4. Start Small
<br />Don't feel you like you have to take on the whole room at once. If you see a guy or gal standing off to the side by themselves maybe take a minute to walk over and introduce yourself. The reality is that they are probably feeling the same way you are and only have to break the ice and work with one person is much easier than trying to work a large audience. Events like the StartUpCrawl are all about meaningful, fun connections. Starting small is usually the best way to make big gains.</p>
