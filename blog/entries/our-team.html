        <p>"For a city to be successful, it has to have a strong sense of community. Events like the StartUp Crawl are a great way to cultivate that community and build lasting relationships between people who may never get a chance to meet otherwise. Anytime you can create a fun, focused and energetic event that brings people together, you're doing something right."

        <p>"Startup Crawl is important for mending the individuals who perform in the Startup Community with the curious and potential role players of the future in Kansas City and globally. I made lasting connections and further solidified my future opportunities with a startup that I later worked for in the Kansas City Startup Village as well as friendships that I have to this day. The benefits from such an experience are immeasurable but very positive for all parties involved."
