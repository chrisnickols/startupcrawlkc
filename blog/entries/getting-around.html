<h1>Getting Around</h1>

<p>With 10 locations at this year's crawl, what's the best way to get around to see all the startups showcased?</p>

<p>The best way is to board one of the chartered crawl shuttles.  Shuttles will depart from six locations at 4:30pm.  They will follow a predetermined loop, stopping at each location.  We estimate that the time between shuttles will be approximately 15 minutes but can vary depending on traffic.  Once on a shuttle, strike up a conversation and make a connection.  You never know who you will sit next to.</p>

<p>If you're in a hurry or want to visit a select few locations, you can always drive your self from location to location.  Remember to drive safely and be responsible.  Better yet, grab an Uber to get you to the next location or even back to your car (Uber rides are standard rates).  </p>
