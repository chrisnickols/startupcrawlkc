<h1>Startup Crawl Sponsors</h1>

<p>Sponsors are super important to being able to put on the crawl.  They allow our attendees to get around the crawl loop in a fun and safe atmosphere.  However, by being a sponor, they are doing more then just providing shuttles for attendees, they are actively supporting the startups in KC and the surrounding areas.  If you are a location, startup or attendees, say thanks for supporting by using their services.</p>
